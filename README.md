## Introduction
This Railway Reservation System project is developed using Python. It provides functionalities such as user registration,Ticket Booking, booking confirmation, and ticket cancellation.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Python
- XAMPP
- SQL Database

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download and Install Python
1. Go to the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
4. Ensure that you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Step 2: Download and Install XAMPP
1. Go to the official XAMPP website: [XAMPP Downloads](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
2. Download the version suitable for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
4. Once installed, open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

### Step 3: Set Up SQL Database
1. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and click on "Admin" next to MySQL to open phpMyAdmin.
2. In phpMyAdmin, create a new database for the railway reservation system.
3. Import the provided SQL file to set up the necessary tables and data.

## Importing Libraries
To ensure the Python script runs correctly, you need to import the necessary libraries. One of the libraries used in this project is `datetime`.

### Importing datetime Library
1. Open your Python IDE or text editor.
2. Add the following line at the beginning of your Python script:
   ```python
   import datetime
   ```

## Running the Project
1. Ensure that XAMPP's Apache and MySQL services are running.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.
4. Run the Python script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

This will start the Railway Reservation System. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the system.
